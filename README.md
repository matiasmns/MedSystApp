I have developed a CRUD system (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) for the registration and management of medical patients. This system is designed to facilitate the efficient and secure administration of patient data.

[GitHub Repo]
https://github.com/matiasmns/MedSystApp/



Technologies used:

Frontend: HTML, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript. These technologies were employed to create an intuitive and responsive user interface, ensuring an optimal user experience.

Backend: PHP and MySQL. PHP was used to develop the server logic and handle client requests, while MySQL was used to manage the database, allowing for secure manipulation and storage of patient information.

System features:

Patient registration: Allows the addition of new patients with detailed information.
Data visualization: Displays a list of all registered patients with their respective data.
Information updating: Facilitates the editing of patient data when necessary.
Record deletion: Enables the secure deletion of patient records from the database.
Data validation: Includes validations on both the frontend and backend to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the entered information.
I am open to any comments or suggestions you may have. I hope you find this system useful.
